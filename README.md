# landing-page
## About
This is my attempt at solving [this](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) assignment from The Odin Project. Instead of filling this website with custom content, I took extra care to make it responsive and clean-looking. Making websites responsive was not, however, covered by the course yet. So it most likely does not follow best practices in that regard.  

## Skills showcased
- HTML
